                    <p class="sound">This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once toward the
                        Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost
                        sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.</p>
                    <p class="sound">For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over
                        the country - and a most curious
                        country it was.</p>

                    <p class="method">The method is this: in an acre of ground you bury, at six inches distance and
                        eight deep, a quantity of acorns, dates,
                        chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables, whereof these animals are fondest then you drive.</p>

                    <p class="method">The tattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed's head, to
                        exclude the wind, which, however, made its
                        way into the comfortless room through the numerous chinks in the door.</p>

                        and sixpences adjusted, to the
                        satisfaction of all parties, Mr. Bob Sawyer rang for supper, and the visitors squeezed.</p>
